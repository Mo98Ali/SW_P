      <h4>What is CBT-I</h4>
      <p>CBT-I is a structured form of therapy aimed at changing poor sleep habits and addressing misconceptions about sleep. It is one of the most effective therapies for treating sleep disorders, especially insomnia.</p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Sleep Diary</h4>
      <p>A sleep diary is an important tool in CBT-I. It helps to identify patterns and habits that may contribute to sleep problems. Users write details about their sleep, including when they go to bed and wake up, how long they lie awake, and other important information. It provides a crucial foundation for applying CBT-I techniques and enables progress tracking.</p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Sleep Hygiene</h4>
      <p>Sleep hygiene is a critical aspect that influences both the quality and quantity of sleep. It encompasses a range of routines and habits aimed at promoting a regular sleep-wake cycle. It also involves optimizing the sleep environment and controlling lifestyle factors that could affect sleep.

        A significant part of good sleep hygiene is limiting screen time before bed. This includes avoiding mobile phones, televisions, and other electronic devices at least half an hour before going to sleep.
        
        Creating a quiet and dark sleep environment is also essential for good sleep hygiene. The bedroom should ideally be cool, dark, and quiet. Moreover, controlling eating and drinking habits before bed can improve sleep. Try to avoid heavy meals and stimulating substances like caffeine and alcohol, as these can disrupt sleep.
        </p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Relaxation Exercises</h4>
      <p>Relaxation exercises are techniques used to reduce physical or mental tension and create a state of increased calm or relaxation. In CBT-I, relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or meditation and yoga can be used to prepare the body for sleep and facilitate falling asleep.</p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Bad Dreams</h4>
      <p>There are many types of nightmares, and a distinction can be made between nightmares and night terrors. Night terrors are much more physically active, because they can startle you and make you scream. It is important not to wake your partner if they are suffering from night terrors, as they are not really awake.
        Nightmares usually manifest themselves through threatening scenarios.
        Triggers for such scenarios are still unknown, but it is assumed that daily stress, trauma and the side effects of medication are a cause of nightmares.
        According to the AOK, the rule of thumb is that for many people, one or more nightmares per week is the limit and the strain is great.
        To get rid of nightmares, one should become aware of the scenario in the dreams. In essence, it is about overcoming the fear by developing a solution strategy for these situations.
        For this, a dream diary can be very helpful, because here you write down your dreams. This should help you to look at your fears and develop better solutions. 
        For example, if you have nightmares in which you are being persecuted, you can think of friends or helpers. 
        However, this solution also includes training and the idea of help in case of persecution or similar help. 
        Anxiety therapies can help with persistent nightmares.

      <h4>What can I do if I can't sleep?</h4>
      <p>Explicit suggestions if you cannot sleep. 
        For insomnia treatment, it is advisable not to try to fall asleep for more than 30 minutes.
        After that time, most people turn over and try to fall asleep in a tense state. 
        On the other hand, it is better to get up and do something fun until you get tired again.
        Since most people are reluctant to do this because they are worried about not being fit enough for the next day, here are a few tips on what you could specifically do at night.
        Tidy up
        Cook ahead for the week
        Exercise
        Read (out of bed) 
        Go for a walk
        Painting
        Knitting
        The list could go on, but the most important thing is not to look at screens while you are awake, as these tend to have a negative effect on getting you back to sleep.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Stimulus Control</h4>
      <p>"Stimulus control is the influencing of behaviour, whether directly observable or covert, through the planned application and control of stimulus conditions preceding the target behaviour."

        In effect, stimulus control is actively observing one's behaviour and how it is influenced by certain stimuli. 
        
        As an example, we can take the topic of screens, because these have been proven to have a bad influence on sleep in general. 
        To control these stimuli, one can stop looking at screens one or two hours before bedtime and rather read a book or do screen-independent activities. 
        
        Or you can avoid substances that suppress sleepiness or reduce sleep quality, such as caffeine, alcohol and other drugs.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Sleep restriction</h4>
      <p>Sleep restriction is helpful in severe cases of sleep disorders, because here the body is deliberately deprived of sleep in order to force it to become tired enough to sleep at some point. 
        For this purpose, the sleeping time is usually limited to a short period of sleep (usually 5 hours). This time is maintained until the first sleep habit works and one regularly sleeps through this "short sleep time". 
        From this point on, the sleep time is continuously increased by 15 minutes. In this way, the person concerned can determine the ideal sleep duration for him/herself.</p>
